# address_book
refining git skills and python coding

The basic idea is to create a working address book, ultimately one I can read from, write to, and update.

Currently the program supports the following functionality:

Text based interface. 

1. list full directory
2. add a person to the directory, 
3. search for a person by name
4. search for all people in a zip code
